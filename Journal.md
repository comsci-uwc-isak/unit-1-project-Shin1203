Q1:What skills haave you developed so far?
  I have learned how to make basic programs in bassh, that can carry out simple functions- such as - printing text in terminal, creating/deleting/editing files, randomizing numbers with loops, using while and for loops, as well as if clause. I have also developed a better mindset for problem solving, before I code I can sometimes visualize my approach/solution to a problem, and work towards that solution.

Q2:What have worked for you in the classroom of CS?
  I found it important to look into new code or something I don't understand outside of the classroom, and master individual topics, otherwise I will struggle later with more complex code that combines multiple ideas from previous classrooms. Reviewing and practising has worked, and also talking with classmates about problems also helps me learn
  
 Q3:What are some things/activities strategies that youwould change in the CS classroom to achieve your best in the next 6 weeks?
  I want to do a better job of organizing files, as well as managing homework, and especially keeping up to date in my journal.
